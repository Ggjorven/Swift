# Swift

## Overview

Swift is a project created by ggjorven, also known as Jorben van der Wal. It serves as a foundational framework rather than a standalone application. Primarily, it provides Vulkan abstractions and incorporates an Input/Event system. However, it's important to note that Swift isn't a conventional library. Instead, it allows the user to change what parts of the library to use.

## Purpose

The primary objective of Swift is to streamline Vulkan development by offering pre-built abstractions and a functional event system. It's designed to simplify the process of creating Vulkan applications by handling boilerplate code and providing a structured foundation for developers to build upon.

## Features

- **Vulkan Abstractions**: Swift encapsulates Vulkan functionality into simplified abstractions, reducing the complexity of Vulkan programming.
  
- **Input/Event System**: It includes a robust input and event management system, facilitating user interaction within Vulkan applications.
  
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured in a modular fashion, allowing developers to easily extend and customize its functionality to suit their specific requirements.

## Getting Started

To integrate Swift into your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the Swift repository into your local development environment.

2. **Build and Configure**: Configure Swift according to your project's specifications. Since it's not a standalone library, you'll need to integrate it into your build system.

3. **Integrate into Your Project**: Incorporate Swift into your project source code. Utilize its abstractions and event system to streamline Vulkan application development.

4. **Customization**: Customize Swift as needed to fit your project requirements. Modify its modules and extend its functionality to achieve your desired outcomes.

5. **Testing and Deployment**: Thoroughly test your integrated application to ensure compatibility and functionality. Deploy your Vulkan application with Swift as its foundational framework.
